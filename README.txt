This basic packet sniffer is a Python script that utilizes the Scapy library to capture and display information about network packets. It's designed to provide a 
simple demonstration of packet sniffing capabilities, including capturing TCP, UDP, and other IP protocol packets, then displaying their source and destination 
IP addresses, ports (for TCP/UDP), and protocol numbers.

Prerequisites:
To run this script, you will need:

	Python: The script is written in Python, so you'll need Python installed on your system. It's recommended to use Python 3.6 or newer.

	Scapy: A powerful Python library used for network packet manipulation and sniffing. You can install Scapy by running pip install scapy in your terminal.

	Sudo privileges: Running the script requires sudo privileges since it needs access to the network interface for packet sniffing.
